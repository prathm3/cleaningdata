##Instructions for project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
   of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Get the data
1.**Download the file and put the file  in the `data` folder**
```{r}
if(!file.exists("./data")){dir.create("./data")}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
download.file(fileUrl,destfile="./data/Dataset.zip",method="curl")
```
2.**Unzip the file** 
```{r}

unzip(zipfile="./data/Dataset.zip",exdir="./data")
```
3.**unzipped files are in the folder`UCI HAR Dataset`. Get the list of the files**
```{r}
path_rf <- file.path("./data" , "UCI HAR Dataset")
files<-list.files(path_rf, recursive=TRUE)
files
```

**See the `README.txt` file for the detailed information on the dataset.**
**For the purposes of this project, the files in the Inertial Signals folders are not used.**
**The files that  will be used to load data are listed as follows:**

- `r files[14]` 
- `r files[15]`
- `r files[16]`
- `r files[26]`
- `r files[27]`
- `r files[28]` 

##Read data from  the  targeted files
1. **Get the big picture of the structure of the data frame that will be used in this project.**

the picture below comes from the picture post on forum by `Community TA  David Hood`.
   
Reference link: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-008/forum/thread?thread_id=24
   
 ![alternate text](https://coursera-forum-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/ab/a2776024af11e4a69d5576f8bc8459/Slide2.png)
   
From the picture and the related files, we can see:

1. Values of Varible `Activity` consist of  data from  "Y_train.txt" and  "Y_test.txt"   
2. values of Varible `Subject` consist of  data from "subject_train.txt" and  subject_test.txt" 
3. Values of Varibles `Features` consist of  data from "X_train.txt" and  "X_test.txt" 
4. Names of Varibles `Features` come from "features.txt"
5. levels of Varible `Activity` come from "activity_labels.txt"

So we will use  `Activity`, `Subject` and `Features` as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame. 

2.**Read data from the files into the variables**

Read the Activity files
```{r}
dataActivityTest  <- read.table(file.path(path_rf, "test" , "Y_test.txt" ),header = FALSE)
dataActivityTrain <- read.table(file.path(path_rf, "train", "Y_train.txt"),header = FALSE)
```

Read the Subject files
```{r}
dataSubjectTrain <- read.table(file.path(path_rf, "train", "subject_train.txt"),header = FALSE)
dataSubjectTest  <- read.table(file.path(path_rf, "test" , "subject_test.txt"),header = FALSE)
```

Read Fearures files
```{r}
dataFeaturesTest  <- read.table(file.path(path_rf, "test" , "X_test.txt" ),header = FALSE)
dataFeaturesTrain <- read.table(file.path(path_rf, "train", "X_train.txt"),header = FALSE)
```

3. **Look at  the properties of the above varibles** 

```{r}
str(dataActivityTest)
str(dataActivityTrain)
str(dataSubjectTrain)
str(dataSubjectTest)
str(dataFeaturesTest)
str(dataFeaturesTrain)
```

##Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

1.**Concatenate the data tables by rows** 
```{r}
dataSubject <- rbind(dataSubjectTrain, dataSubjectTest)
dataActivity<- rbind(dataActivityTrain, dataActivityTest)
dataFeatures<- rbind(dataFeaturesTrain, dataFeaturesTest)
```

2.**set  names to variables**
```{r}
names(dataSubject)<-c("subject")
names(dataActivity)<- c("activity")
dataFeaturesNames <- read.table(file.path(path_rf, "features.txt"),head=FALSE)
names(dataFeatures)<- dataFeaturesNames$V2
```

3.**Merge columns to get the data frame `Data` for all data**
```{r}
dataCombine <- cbind(dataSubject, dataActivity)
Data <- cbind(dataFeatures, dataCombine)
```

##Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

1. **Subset Name of Features by measurements on the mean and standard deviation** 

i.e taken Names of Features with "mean()" or "std()"
```{r}
subdataFeaturesNames<-dataFeaturesNames$V2[grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", dataFeaturesNames$V2)]
```

2. **Subset the data frame `Data` by seleted names of Features**
```{r}
selectedNames<-c(as.character(subdataFeaturesNames), "subject", "activity" )
Data<-subset(Data,select=selectedNames)
```

3. **Check the structures of the data frame `Data`**
```{r}
str(Data)
```

##Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

1.**Read descriptive activity names from "activity_labels.txt"**

```{r}
activityLabels <- read.table(file.path(path_rf, "activity_labels.txt"),header = FALSE)
```

2. **facorize Variale `activity` in  the data frame `Data` using  descriptive activity names** 
```{r echo=FALSE}
Data$activity<-factor(Data$activity);
Data$activity<- factor(Data$activity,labels=as.character(activityLabels$V2))
```

3.**check**
```{r}
head(Data$activity,30)
```

## Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
In the former part, variables activity and subject and names of the activities have been labelled 
using descriptive names.In this part, Names of Feteatures will labelled using descriptive variable
names.

- prefix t  is replaced by  time
- Acc is replaced by Accelerometer
- Gyro is replaced by Gyroscope
- prefix f is replaced by frequency
- Mag is replaced by Magnitude
- BodyBody is replaced by Body

```{r}
names(Data)<-gsub("^t", "time", names(Data))
names(Data)<-gsub("^f", "frequency", names(Data))
names(Data)<-gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(Data))
names(Data)<-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(Data))
names(Data)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(Data))
names(Data)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(Data))
```

check
```{r}
names(Data)
```

## Creates a second,independent tidy data set and ouput it
In this part,a second, independent tidy data set will be created with the average 
of each variable for each activity and each subject  based on the data set in step 4. 

```{r}
library(plyr);
Data2<-aggregate(. ~subject + activity, Data, mean)
Data2<-Data2[order(Data2$subject,Data2$activity),]
write.table(Data2, file = "tidydata.txt",row.name=FALSE)
```

####Prouduce Codebook
```{r}
library(knitr)
knit2html("codebook.Rmd");
```
